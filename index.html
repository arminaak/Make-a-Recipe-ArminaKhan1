    <h2>Steps</h2>
      </center>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
      <li div class="main">Take out both sticks of butter so it can warm up to room temperature.</li>
      <li>Open both garlics and cut both shallots in half.</li>
      <li>Place the garlic and shallots in a piece of foil big enough to wrap them up. Drizzle your olive oil onto the garlic and shallots. Sprinly as much black pepper as you'd like. Then, place them in the oven for 15 minutes at 350 degrees. </li>
      <li>While your garlic and shallots are in the oven, mash your butter up with a fork until it has the same consistency as mayonaise.</li>
      <li>After the garlic and shallots are done roasting, take them out, peel off and throw out the skin. When the garlic and shallot is cool enough to hande, mix them in with the butter.</li>
      <li>Take your bread, and cut it in half.</li>
      <li div class="main">Spread the paste you've created of butter, garlic, and shallots on each half of the bread.</li>
      <li div class="main">Take your mozzarella, and spread as much cheese as you'd like on each half of the bread.</li>
      <li>Place the bread in the oven again for 25 minutes, or until the cheese completely melts. Make sure to not let it burn.</li>
      <!--I added a div class to some of the most important steps to make those steps stand out.-->
    </ol>
    <center>
    <p>Now you have made your cheesy garlic bread! Cut into pieces, and enjoy.</p>
